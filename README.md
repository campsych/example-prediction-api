Prediction API example
====================== 

This is just an example code to integrate with [Apply Magic Sauce](https://applymagicsauce.com/)

It shows how to talk to/read from Prediction API using popular (as far as data science goes) languages and most common packages. 

Note you need an account to really use it and there's approval process for that. This code itself does nothing on its own.
